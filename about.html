              In the western part of the world, if you utter the word “Yoga,”
                 people think of impossible physical postures. This is a very distorted idea 
                 of what Yoga is. Yoga is not about bending and twisting your body or holding 
                 your breath. It is a mechanism and a technology to get you to that state of 
                 experience where you see reality just the way it is.<br>

                The word “Yoga” literally means “union.”</span></h2>
