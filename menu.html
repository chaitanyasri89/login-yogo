        Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow 
        and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength.<br>

         above the knee (but never on the knee) at a right angle. <br>
        Try to focus on one spot in front of you, while you balance for one minute.<br> </h3>

        <h3>Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility 
            in people with lower back pain. The American College of Physicians recommends
             yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.<br>

            Get on all fours, placing your palms underneath your shoulders and your knees
             underneath your hips. First, inhale, as you let your stomach drop down toward 
             the floor. Then, exhale, as you draw your navel toward your spine,
              arching your spine like a cat stretching.<br> </h3>

                       be addressed through yoga.<br>
