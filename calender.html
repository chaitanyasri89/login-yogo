            <h2><font style="color:black">Yoga in a yoga studio is primarily a
                 physical endeavor, and so your best advice is to go slow. After 60 days
                  you can move to 4-5 times a week. That might look like Monday, Wednesday,
                   Friday and a Saturday or Sunday.<br>
                 Always have at least one day of rest each week.<br>
                 In his book "Light on Yoga," B.K.S. Iyengar advises doing yoga early 
                 in the morning or late in the evening, noting that there are advantages
                  to each.<br> "Practice in the morning makes one work better at one's vocation. 
                  In the evening it removes the fatigue of the
                  day's strain and makes one fresh and calm," he said.</h2>

            It began as a spiritual practice but has become popular as a way of 
            promoting physical and mental well-being. Although classical yoga also
             includes other elements, yoga as practiced in the United States typically
              emphasizes physical postures (asanas),
             breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation (dyana).

        Evening or morning? Most yoga schools say that the best time to
         practice yoga is with sunrise. But this may not hold true for people who
          sleep late or don't feel comfortable working out in the morning. 
          If you are also a night owl, do not let this
         philosophy stop you from practicing this brilliant form of workout.</h2>
